# Final Project
#This Project is designed to simulate a High Level Idea of a website Idea have. 
#Because the project is too long for this Final Project Some of the information
#that would be gotten from an api will be simulated as best as possible to create a some
#what realistic simulation 

# The Project is to take information from Google flights and AirBnb to create a vacation plan
# the user will enter a desired budget, a time span(flexible and none Flexible) 
# they can travel within, as well the number of days they would like to travel for. 
# for now we assume no collisons of booking between two different customers looking at the 
# same flight,airbnb or both.
